# CMPUT301Assignment1

This is a very basic local claim management system built for CMPUT 301 (software engineering)

The app apk is CMPUT301Assignment1.apk

I made use of the GSON library for serialization, it can be found here: https://code.google.com/p/google-gson/

I also used the icons provided here: https://developer.android.com/design/downloads/index.html#action-bar-icon-pack
